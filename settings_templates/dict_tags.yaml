# The 'tags' feature is a versatile method to tailor the bot's behavior for your use case.
# tags may be defined in this file for global effect, as well as in character cards and imgmodel definitions.

# Notes:
# - 'trigger' key is recommended for most tags (except 'global_tag_keys' and 'tag_preset_name').
# - Multiple comma-separated trigger phrases can be used per each tag (trigger: 'a boy,a dog' can match either 'a boy' or 'a dog')
# - You may simplify triggers using this syntax: 'a {boy|dog}' --- the script will read this as 'a boy,a dog'
# - The behavior of tags listed higher may override ones listed lower. Sources are also prioritized: character > imgmodel > base_tags
# - Valid tag keys are detailed at the end of this file and on GitHub

# 'global_tag_keys' apply to ALL tag definitions. Keys defined elsewhere will override global tag keys.

  positive_prompt_method: after   # Relevant in tags with key 'positive_prompt'. 'after' = insert value after matched text / 'before' = before text / 'replace' = replace text

# List of all available tag keys:
#
# Conditional tags:
#   search_mode: userllm              Search method for trigger matching. 'user' = user prompt only / 'llm' = bot reply only / 'userllm' = search both for matches
#   trigger: 'trigger,another one'    Recommended for most tags (except 'global_tag_keys' and 'tag_preset_name').
#   random: 0.5                       Chance for tag to process. 0.0 = 0% chance and 1.0 = 100% chance.
#   case_sensitive: (true/false)      If the triggers are case sensitive
#   on_prefix_only: (true/false)      If triggers must be matched at beginning of the searched text

# Relevant to both text/img generation:
#   send_user_image: 'string'         Sends a local image to the channel. Value values: Image in 'user_images' (png/jpg/txt in base64) -OR- Directory name in '/user_images/'
#                                       (Picks a random image or random image from random subdirectory)
#   flow: {dict}                      A dict of 'flow_steps'. When a 'flow' tag is triggered, it creates a message loop for each defined 'loop_step'
#   flow_step: [list]                 The tags you want to apply in each flow step.  Without a trigger, they will auto-apply.  'format_prompt' is very useful in each flow_step
#   flow_step_loops: int              The number of times you want to loop a particular flow_step.

# Relevant to text generation (LLM):
#   should_gen_text: (true/false)     If LLM should generate text. If False and 'should_gen_image' is True, passes the user's text as prompt for image gen.
#   should_send_text: (true/false)    If LLM should send generated text to channel. Mainly used for 'flows' tag.
#   change_llmmodel: 'string'         For (change/swap)_llmmodel: 'change' will trigger a persistent change. 'swap' will only change the LLM model for the current interaction.
#   swap_llmmodel: 'string'           Name of an LLM model (ei: 'Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GPTQ'). Value 'None' will unload the LLM model!
#   time_offset: 0.0                  0 = today's date (system time). -0.5 shifts the current date to be 12 hours ago. (UOM = days). Use with '{time}' anywhere in your prompts
#   time_format: '%H:%M:%S'           Examples: '%H:%M:%S' (HH:MM:SS), '%I:%M:%S %p' (12HR:MM:SS AM/PM)
#   date_format: '%Y-%m-%d'           Examples: '%Y-%m-%d' (YYYY-MM-DD), '%A, %B %d, %Y' (DayName, MonthName DD, YYYY)
#   format_prompt: 'string'           Useful for adding text before and/or after your prompt to the LLM. **If you do not include {prompt}, your prompt will be replaced entirely with the value of 'format_prompt'.** Can include any variables, see '/tips_and_info/Message Variables.txt'
#   insert_text: ''                   Text you may want to insert relative to the matched search text.
#   insert_text_method: replace       Relevant in tags with key 'pinsert_text'. 'after' = insert value after matched text / 'before' = before text / 'replace' = replace text
#   text_joining: ' '                 Relevant to all insertion methods except "replace"
#   change_character: 'string'        Filename of character in /characters (do not include extension). That character's name, context, and state parameters will be used in LLM payload.
#   swap_character: 'string'          For (change/swap)_character: 'change' will trigger a persistent change. 'swap' will only change the character for the current interaction.
#   load_history: 0                   0 = default (all history included) / -1 = prompt excludes chat history / > 1 = llm only sees this many recent exchanges.
#   save_history: (true/false)        Whether to save this interaction to history or not.
#   state: {dictionary}               Update values for textgen-webui state parameters. Must be formatted as a dictionary.
#   prefix_context: 'string'          Inserts text immediately before the 'context', joined by \n (new line). Multiple can accumulate.
#   suffix_context: 'string'          Inserts text immediately after the 'context', joined by \n (new line). Multiple can accumulate.
#   llm_param_variances: {dictionary} Randomization ranges for textgen-webui state parameters. Must be formatted as a dictionary.

# Relevant to img generation (A1111 / Forge):
#   sd_output_dir: 'string'           Location to save any generated images. Default: 'ad_discordbot/sd_outputs/'
#   should_gen_image: (true/false)    If bot should generate an image using Stable Diffusion. The LLM's reply will be used as the img prompt, unless no LLM Model is loaded or 'should_gen_text' is False - in which case user message is prompt.
#   should_send_image: (true/false)   If bot should send generated image to channel. Mainly used for 'flows' tag.
#   change_imgmodel: 'string'         For (change/swap)_imgmodel: 'change' will trigger a persistent change. 'swap' will only change the Img model for the current interaction.
#   swap_imgmodel: 'string'           Copy/paste a checkpoint name *exactly* as it appears in A1111/Forge model list (ei: 'sdxl\epicrealismXL_v4Photoreal.safetensors [c772a1a690]').
#                                     Currently, API Img model unloading is bugged in both A1111/Forge so that is not an option here.
#   img_censoring: 0                  0 = disabled / 1 = blur image / 2 = block image from being generated
#   positive_prompt: 'string'         Text you may want to insert relative to the matched text in the image prompt.
#   positive_prompt_method: after     Relevant to 'positive_prompt'. 'after' = insert value after matched text / 'before' = before text / 'replace' = replace text
#   positive_prompt_prefix: 'string'  Insert text at the beginning of the image positive prompt
#   positive_prompt_suffix: 'string'  Insert text at the end of the image positive prompt
#   negative_prompt_prefix: 'string'  Insert text at the beginning of the image negative prompt
#   negative_prompt: 'string'         Insert text at the end of the image negative prompt ('_suffix' also works)
#   img_text_joining: ', '            Relevant to all insertion methods except "replace"
#   payload: {dictionary}             Replacements for Stable Diffusion payload. Must be formatted as a dictionary.
#   aspect_ratio: 'string'            This a shortcut to dynamically set the payload width/height dimensions based on the current average dimensions. Valid values examples: '4:3', '16:9', '2:3', etc
#   img_param_variances: {dictionary} Randomization ranges for Stable Diffusion payload parameters. Must be formatted as a dictionary.
#   img2img: 'string'                 Uses a local image as img2img input. Value values: Image in 'user_images' (png/jpg/txt in base64) -OR- Directory name in '/user_images/' (Picks a random image or random image from random subdirectory)
#   img2img_mask: 'string'            AKA Inpainting. Won't have any effect without img2img also triggered. Should be a greyscale image. Value values: Image in 'user_images' (png/jpg/txt in base64) -OR- Directory name in '/user_images/' (Picks a random image or random image from random subdirectory)

# HINT: tags can be created/activated on-demand if using this sytax in your prompt: [[key:value]] or [[key1:value1 | key2:value2]] etc
#       EXAMPLE (Single tag):     [[reactor_max_faces:6]]
#       EXAMPLE (Multiple tags):  [[reactor_save_original:True | laydiff_weight:0.5]]
#   ** This is a good way to add specific extension parameters on-demand!! **


# ControlNet specific tags (A1111/Forge extension):
#   controlnet: 'string'              Simplified tag to both **apply** ControlNet image/folder AND **enable** ControlNet.
#   controlnet#: 'string'             Optional syntax for multi-ControlNet where # represents the ControlNet unit. ex: 'controlnet0: guy.png', 'controlnet1: architecture', etc.
#                                     Value values: Image in 'user_images' (png/jpg/txt in base64) -OR- Directory name in '/user_images/' (Picks a random image or random image from random subdirectory)
#   cnet_{key}                        ANY key can be used (see dict_base_settings.yaml for complete list). A 'controlnet' tag must also be in effect when using these tags in order to properly assign the image.
#   cnet#_{key}: 'string'             Optional syntax for multi-ControlNet parameters where # represents the ControlNet unit. ex: 'cnet0_weight: 0.5', 'cnet1_guidance_end: 0.8', etc.
#   cnet#_mask: 'string'              The value for the 'cnet_mask_image' param will be handled exactly the same as the main controlnet (see writeup for 'controlnet' a few lines up). 'cnet#_mask_image' is also valid.
#   cnet#_control_type: 'string'      Optional. If provided: for any controlnet image value (including mask) that is not a specific filename (ei: its directory name), it will try looking for this filename.

# Forge Couple specific tags (Forge extension):
#   forgecouple: 'string' OR [list]   Simplified tag to both **apply** AND **enable** Forge Couple.
#                                     For Basic mode, use string: 'Horizontal' / 'Vertical'. For Advanced mode, use a list of lists (refer to dict_base_settings.yaml)
#   couple_{key}                      ANY key can be used (see dict_base_settings.yaml for complete list). Note: Forge Couple will not be enabled without a 'forgecouple' tag.

# layerdiffuse specific tags (Forge extension):

#   laydiff_{key}                     ANY key can be used (see dict_base_settings.yaml for complete list). Note: layerdiffusion will not be enabled without either a 'layerdiffuse' or 'laydiff_method' tag.

# ReActor specific tags (A1111/Forge extension):
#   reactor: 'string'                 Simplified tag to both **apply** face image/folder/model AND **enable** ReActor.
#                                     Value values: Image in 'user_images' (png/jpg/txt in base64) -OR- Directory name in '/user_images/' (Picks a random image or random image from random subdirectory) -OR- Face model in '{SD_CLIENT}\models\reactor\faces' example 'M1nty.safetensors'
#   reactor_{key}                     ANY key can be used (see dict_base_settings.yaml for complete list).
#                                     Recommended to use in combination with 'reactor' tag - otherwise, you can't use "single face image method"
#                                     (technically, you could send a base64 string... and you would need to include 'reactor_enabled: True')
#   reactor_mask                      Value values: Image in 'user_images' (png/jpg/txt in base64), directory, etc. Should be a greyscale image, which will mask the face swap result.
