_inject_placeholders.bat
_resolve_placeholders.bat

These utilities help with formatting API payloads in a way the main bot script expects, for getting dynamically set values during runtime, into payload fields before submitting to API clients.

** Original files are never overwritten **
** Actions performed are logged to a txt file **



# Usage instructions:

1. Copy and rename the template files to 'injections.yaml' and 'overrides.yaml'

You may tailor these for whatever payload you will be dropping into the utility scripts.

overrides.json
  - Essentially, "your defaults" when using the utility script.
  - The __overrides__ dict will be added to payload files.
  - The main bot script will expect it and use it intelligently, and automatically remove it when calling APIs

injections.yaml
  - If provided, the utility script will scan for and automatically replace matching key values with these placeholder strings.
  - You can always link overrides in your payload manually. In some cases, you will have to.



2. Drag and Drop any payload / dict-like file (json, yaml, yml) onto a .bat file

_inject_placeholders.bat
  - Adds __overrides__ dict from 'overrides.json'
  - Scans the payload for any keys defined in 'injections''
    If found, will substitute values with placeholder strings like "{prompt}".
    You can always handle this manually.

_resolve_placeholders.bat
  - Aims to recover payload files back to their original state.
  - You may need to manually correct some references.
